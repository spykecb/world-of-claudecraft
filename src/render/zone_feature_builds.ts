// Zone feature builds for the renderer's zone prepares (renderer.ts
// ensureZoneFeatures, prepareZoneAt).
//
// Every zone feature builder used to run in one main-thread call when its
// zone streamed in, so walking into a new zone cost one long frame per
// builder: Veiled Hollow's flora was 161 ms on the calibrated desktop proxy
// and 222 ms on the reference phone. A builder written as a stepped build
// (stepped_build_core.ts) is now prebuilt here during a BACKGROUND prepare,
// in idle slices the size the terrain lane uses, beside the zone's terrain
// build, and the renderer's synchronous ensureZoneFeatures takes the finished
// view instead of building it. A gating prepare (behind the loading cover)
// does not prebuild: it runs the builder in one call as before, which also
// covers a prebuild still in flight when a gating caller builds the feature
// first (the prebuild stops and its result is dropped).
//
// Every builder call is timed into the build ledger under
// `zone:features:<name>`; a prebuild records each slice, so the ledger's
// worst entry is the worst frame the build cost.
